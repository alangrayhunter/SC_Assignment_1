# Question 1

```{r}
# Import Packages

# Install dplyr if not already installed
if (!requireNamespace("dplyr", quietly = TRUE)) {
  install.packages("dplyr") 
} 
library(dplyr)

# Install tidyverse if not already installed
if (!requireNamespace("tidyverse", quietly = TRUE)) {
  install.packages("tidyverse")
}
library(tidyverse)

# Install nycflights13 for flight data
if (!requireNamespace("nycflights13", quietly = TRUE)) {
  install.packages("nycflights13")
}
```

```{r}
# load nycflights13  flight data
data(flights, package = "nycflights13") 
flights <- as_tibble(flights)
flights
```

# Question 2



```{r}
# Filter flights by month = 1 (January)
 flights_jan <- flights |> 
   filter(month == 1) |> 
   select(carrier,distance)
```

```{r}
# Group the January flights by carrier
flights_jan_by_carrier <- flights_jan |> 
  group_by(carrier) |> 
  summarise(Mean = mean(distance), SD = sd(distance))
```


#Question 3


```{r}
# Filtering the January Flights to see all flights from the two carriers of interest
flights_jan |> 
  filter(carrier == "OO")
flights_jan |> 
  filter(carrier == "F9")
```

We can see that the carrier 00 has only one distance recorded in January, and that F9 has many, but all of them are equal to 1620.

```{r}
# Make objects containing all the rows of flight distances from each carrier
distance.00 <- flights_jan |> 
  filter(carrier == "OO") |> 
    select(distance)
distance.F9 <- flights_jan |> 
  filter(carrier == "F9") |> 
    select(distance)
```

```{r}
# Find the standard deviation of each of the carriers January flights.
sd.00 <- distance.00 |> 
  summarise(SD = sd(distance))
sd.F9 <-  distance.F9 |> 
  summarise(SD = sd(distance))
sd.00
sd.F9
```

Carrier "00" only has one distance (or row), and so cannot have a standard deviation, hence the standard deviation is "na".

Carrier "F9" has many distances but they are all equal, hence standard deviation is equal to 0.


#Question 4

```{r}
flights_dep_delay <- flights |> 
  select(month,dep_delay,carrier)
```


```{r}
flights_dep_delay_averages <- flights_dep_delay |> 
  group_by(month,carrier) |> 
  summarise(avg_dep_delay = mean(dep_delay))
flights_dep_delay_averages
```


```{r}
flights_dep_delay_wide <- flights_dep_delay_averages |> 
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = carrier,
    values_from = avg_dep_delay
  )
flights_dep_delay_wide
```

```{r}
flights_dep_delay |> 
  filter(carrier == "B6")
```
